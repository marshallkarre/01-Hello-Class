# 01-Hello-Class


* Hello, my name is Karre Marshall. As of now, my favorite game has to be Call of Duty. Since I am a late addition to this course, I am concerned about how long it'll take for me to catch up.
Even with this fact in mind, I am stil interested in this course, and I'm excited to to explore the various aspects that programming involves. I am stack overflow user number 8544876. The link
